## Usage
### Example Usage in `main.py`
The `main.py` file provides examples of how to use the various features of the Property Management System:

```python
from property import Property
from tenant import Tenant
from lease import Lease
from maintenance_request import MaintenanceRequest
from payment import Payment

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage of the classes

    # Property example
    property = Property("P001", "123 Main St", "Apartment", "Available", 1200.0)
    Property.add_property(property)
    print("Property added:", property.address)

    # Tenant example
    tenant = Tenant("T001", "John Doe", "555-1234", "L001")
    Tenant.add_tenant(tenant)
    print("Tenant added:", tenant.name)

    # Lease example
    lease = Lease("L001", "P001", "T001", "2024-01-01", "2025-01-01", 1200.0)
    Lease.create_lease(lease)
    print("Lease created:", lease.start_date)

    # Maintenance request example
    request = MaintenanceRequest("R001", "T001", "P001", "Leaky faucet", "Pending", "2024-07-25")
    MaintenanceRequest.submit_request(request)
    print("Maintenance request submitted:", request.description)

    # Payment example
    payment = Payment("PAY001", "T001", "L001", 1200.0, "2024-01-01")
    Payment.make_payment(payment)
    print("Payment made: $", payment.amount)
```

## Running Tests
Unit tests are provided in the `tests` package. To run the tests:

1. **Run all tests in the `tests` package:**
    - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
    - Run the following command:
